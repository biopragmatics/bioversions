This site and accompanying package are a resource for informing you what the latest version of each biological database
is. Last updated on {{ site.data.versions.annotations.date }} (revision {{ site.data.versions.annotations.revision }})
by {{ site.data.versions.annotations.author }}.

This site also includes [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) annotations, which
aims to improve the findability of life sciences resources such as datasets,
software, and training materials. These annotations can either appear on the
original site, or on a website (like this one) that indexes it or provides
additional information. The further information here, for example, is the link
to the BioRegistry. The JSON-LD annotation will make it easier for other
tools to recognize the content of the table. This includes the [Google Dataset
finder](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), besides Bioschemas itself.

Legend: ðŸ“¥ means the resource reports the date of each release, ðŸ“… means the date of release was inferred based on the
date when the latest version was retrieved, ðŸ’¡ means the date was inferred by the version string.

## Adding More Databases

More databases can be added by sending a pull request to [biopragmatics/bioversions](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioversions)
by following the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioversions#-contributing).

Databases are added by the following priority (high to low):

1. By request or contribution
2. Databases useful for the [PyOBO](https://github.com/pyobo/pyobo) project, aiming to convert all biomedical controlled
   vocabularies into OBO for general reuse
3. Databases useful for the [Bio2BEL](https://github.com/bio2bel/bio2bel) project, aiming to convert all biological
   databases into the [Biological Expression Language](https://biological-expression-language.github.io/) for general
   reuse and Bio2BEL projects
4. Databases appearing in the Bioregistry, OLS, OBO Foundry, or MIRIAM
5. Databases tweeted by the International Society of Biocuration ([@biocurator](https://twitter.com/biocurator))
6. Databases I've seen during project work
7. Serendipity!

## Database Updates

The database is automatically updated daily thanks to scheduled workflows in GitHub Actions. The workflow's
configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioversions/blob/main/.github/workflows/update.yml)
and the last run can be
seen [here](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioversions/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Update+Database%22). Further,
a [changelog](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioversions/commits?author=actions-user) can be recapitulated from the commits
of the GitHub Actions bot.
